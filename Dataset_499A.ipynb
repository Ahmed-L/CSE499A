            "NSU: A BRIEF HISTORY\n",
            "North South University (NSU), the first private university in Bangladesh, was established in 1992 by the then Foundation for Promotion of Education and Research (FPER), a charitable, non-profit, non-commercial and non-political organization. The FPER later was renamed as the NSU Foundation and is presently called The North South Foundation for Education and Research. The Foundation is comprised of a group of eminent industrialists, prominent patrons of education, notable philanthropists, widely experienced academics and senior civil servants of the country. In the early 1990s, they had a dream to set up a world-class university as a center of excellence in higher education in the private sector. Their dedication, tireless efforts, and hard work paved the way for the approval of the establishment of NSU.\n",
            "Since, at that time, there was no relevant law in the country to set up and operate a university in the private sector, they took the entire burden on themselves and extended their best efforts in assisting the then government in formulating the relevant law and enacting it. Subsequently, the government, pursuant to the newly enacted law the Private University Act (PUA)-1992 (now repealed by PUA-2010), approved the establishment of NSU. The University was formally inaugurated on 10 February 1993 and started its journey in a very modest way. Later, in 2012, the NSU Foundation, in the light of the PUA 2010 and as instructed by the Ministry of Education and the University Grants Commission, formed the NSU Trust with the same group of people as the Foundation and vested the entire management and administration of NSU in its Board of Trustees (BOT). The Honorable President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh is the Chancellor of NSU.\n",
            "The Board of Trustees (BOT) is the apex policy making and approving body of the university. Mr. M. A. Kashem is the current Chairman of the BOT. A renowned industrialist of the country.\n",
            "None\n",
            "The Syndicate is next to the BOT and is headed by the Vice-Chancellor. The Vice-Chancellor is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the University. He is responsible for managing the administrative and academic affairs of the university as per the Private University Act (PUA 2010), and implementing the policy guidelines set by the BOT. The Vice-Chancellor is assisted by a Pro Vice-Chancellor and a Treasurer. All of them are appointed by the Honorable Chancellor on recommendation of the BOT.\n",

            "NSU: A BRIEF HISTORY\n",
            "North South University (NSU), the first private university in Bangladesh, was established in 1992 by the then Foundation for Promotion of Education and Research (FPER), a charitable, non-profit, non-commercial and non-political organization. The FPER later was renamed as the NSU Foundation and is presently called The North South Foundation for Education and Research. The Foundation is comprised of a group of eminent industrialists, prominent patrons of education, notable philanthropists, widely experienced academics and senior civil servants of the country. In the early 1990s, they had a dream to set up a world-class university as a center of excellence in higher education in the private sector. Their dedication, tireless efforts, and hard work paved the way for the approval of the establishment of NSU.\n",
            "Since, at that time, there was no relevant law in the country to set up and operate a university in the private sector, they took the entire burden on themselves and extended their best efforts in assisting the then government in formulating the relevant law and enacting it. Subsequently, the government, pursuant to the newly enacted law the Private University Act (PUA)-1992 (now repealed by PUA-2010), approved the establishment of NSU. The University was formally inaugurated on 10 February 1993 and started its journey in a very modest way.

Majors offered by the English department at the undergraduate level are widely recognized. They prepare students to engage in many fields, including graduate degrees in teaching, journalism, information technology, management, law and administration, as well as more language-focused fields like creative writing and translation. The department initially started with general education non-credit English courses like ENG097 and ENG102, and credits courses such as ENG103 and ENG105 for all the departments. The service courses have been revised and redesigned periodically in order to make them more effective and relevant to the needs of students. New courses were also introduced keeping in view the demands and changes taking place in English studies and employment opportunities throughout the world.\n",
            "The current curriculum followed in the Department of English & Modern Languages in commensurate with some of the most prestigious universities in the United States. With two  international faculty members from the USA both holding doctoral degrees, and with all other faculty members with graduate degrees, including 7 with doctorate degrees, from highly-rated foreign institutions, the department provides an international high-quality platform for its students.\n",
            "Students in the department are guided to shape their studies in order to reflect their specific interest as they prepare themselves to assume their roles as ethical and intellectual members of society. The department has expanded over the years and continues to pursue its goals and objectives vigorously. The students with specializations in the areas of literature, linguistics, or TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) choose courses based on their requirements and areas of interest. The main focus of both the undergraduate and graduate curricula is to prepare students most effectively to face the challenges of employment and leadership in their fields. With over 40 core faculty members and 19 adjunct faculty members, the favorable teacher-to-student ratio enables the department to be one of the most successful in NSU.\n",

            "Graduate education, comprised of Graduate Diploma, Master and PhD study programs, is an important investment in one’s career development. This is more so in an increasingly globalized job market. In appreciation of this reality, North South University already offers 15 graduate study programs at master’s level (see the list below). These programs, taught by faculty members with PhD degree from reputed universities, offer excellent opportunities for fresh undergraduates as well as those who are in jobs already to further develop their potential as intellectual leaders for a wide range of career paths in business, industry, government, research institutions, universities, NGOs and international agencies.   In January 2015, NSU took another pioneering step by establishing an Office of Graduate Studies and Research (GSR).

            "Graduate education, comprised of Graduate Diploma, Master and PhD study programs, is an important investment in one’s career development. This is more so in an increasingly globalized job market. In appreciation of this reality, North South University already offers 15 graduate study programs at master’s level (see the list below). These programs, taught by faculty members with PhD degree from reputed universities, offer excellent opportunities for fresh undergraduates as well as those who are in jobs already to further develop their potential as intellectual leaders for a wide range of career paths in business, industry, government, research institutions, universities, NGOs and international agencies.   In January 2015, NSU took another pioneering step by establishing an Office of Graduate Studies and Research (GSR). It is entrusted with the overall responsibility of enhancing quality of graduate education by promoting coordination among NSU’s graduate education programs and facilitating learning from each other’s experiences as well as from national and international experiences. Schools and departments are responsible for the design and delivery of graduate research programs and for the welfare of graduate students. The overarching goal of the Office of the Graduate Studies and Research is to contribute to NSU acquiring increased national and international recognition as a quality graduate degree-conferring institution.\n",
