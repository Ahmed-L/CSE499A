            "I am pleased to welcome you to the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology (BMD) housed in the School of Health and Life Sciences at the North South University. Currently two undergraduate programs (BS in Biochemistry & Biotechnology and BS in Microbiology) and one graduate program (MS in Biotechnology) are offered. We have almost all the amenities to support our faculties to conduct world-class research as well as we provide a homogeneous environment for one-on-one interaction amongst faculty, staff and students at all levels.\n",
            "Our Department started its journey back in 2006. Since then we are maintaining a long tradition of excellence in teaching and research. It has only been possible because of the faculty, students and staff dedicated to promote cutting edge research, outstanding teaching and service to the university. In addition, the establishment of NSU Genome Research Institute (NGRI) in 2017 has expanded the dimension of research in microbial genetics & pathogenesis, genomics, biochemistry, molecular biology and immunology at the department. As scientific investigators, faculties here are not only engaged in teaching but also in training the next generation of talented young scientists who will meet the challenges of the 21st century. Our research spans the broad areas of Microbiology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Under the current global crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Microbiology and Biochemistry are the sciences that have emerged as the vital source of information to combat this notorious agent.\n",
            "The department focuses in developing young individuals who will contribute to the academia, industry, government and non-government organizations locally and internationally in the days ahead. Therefore, students enrolled in our programs have the unique opportunity to receive quality education for the personal and professional growth. Our research efforts which are supported by the university and external funds allow students to make novel and intriguing observations that they can present in national and international meetings and publish in national and international peer-reviewed journals. Students also have the opportunity to participate in several student organizations including “The NSU Bioscience Club” which is supervised by one of our esteemed faculty members. The purpose of this club is to promote students’ interest in life sciences and connect them with the academic and professional world.\n",
            "We are indeed proud of our internationally recognized faculty members, all of whom have MS and/or PhD degrees primarily from the USA, Canada, UK, Japan and Australia.

            "Language performs a vital role in communication. Good proficiency in language is important since access to higher education depends on it. The Institute of Modern Languages came into existence in 2009. Although its primary goal is to encourage and facilitate students’ learning of foreign languages at NSU, people from outside of NSU can also enroll in its language courses and participate in the wide range of events and activities it organizes for the students. Since spring 2013, the Institute has offered language development and proficiency programs in the form of intensive courses in seven widely used international languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Arabic, and Bangla). Students enrolled in the Institute of Modern Languages have access to special classrooms equipped with multimedia and computer facilities. All IML courses are conducted by appropriately qualified and experienced instructors. In addition to the language courses, the Institute also organizes a wide variety of special events, such as, seminars, IML lecture series events, and workshops to encourage research and raise language awareness and interest among students as well as the teachers of English at NSU and also of other universities in Bangladesh.\n",

            "Quality Assurance in Higher Education is a global practice now. It has become vital for higher education to be closely aligned with the needs of the community and needs of the graduates to explore their potential in terms of employability and lifelong learning. Understanding the emerging need of quality in higher education, the Government of Bangladesh established Institutional Quality Assurance Cells (IQAC) at different universities. At North South University (NSU), the Institutional Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) was established on January 12, 2016. The NSU-IQAC aspires to help establish a culture of quality in both academic and administrative support operations and to support the university accomplish its vision to become and remain a center of excellence in higher education in Bangladesh and beyond. We intend to use the IQAC as the “go to place” for all quality related resources and information at NSU.\n",

The instructor must file with the Registrar an Incomplete Grade form describing the work to be completed, indicating a tentative final grade to be assigned if the work is not completed and the time period in which the work must be completed (no longer than the following semester).The student has the responsibility to take the initiative in completing the work and is expected to make up the incomplete as specified by the instructor. If action is not taken the \"I\" grade will revert to the tentative final grade. The final grade becomes an \"F\" if no tentative grade is assigned. In the event the instructor from whom a student received an incomplete is not available, the disposition of a case involving an incomplete grade resides with the Head of the Department.

When a student retakes a course, the actual grade will be recorded instead of \"R\". All passing grades will be used to calculate the CGPA even if a course is retaken. When a student retakes a course in which student received \"F\" grade(s) earlier, s/he must apply not to include the \"F\" grade(s) in his/her CGPA calculation. An \"F\" grade earned in any credit course will be used to calculate CGPA until the course is retaken and an application is submitted. The retake policy in case of courses with \"F\" grades will apply immediately to all students at NSU irrespective of their date of enrollment. There will be no limit on the number of times a course can be retaken.

            "Undergraduate Degree Requirements\n",
            "As NSU is based on the US University system, all undergraduate degrees are of four years duration. For each degree, except B.A. in English, at least 124 credits are required. A minimum of 123 credit is required for B.A. in English degree. If an undergraduate student takes 15-16 credits per semester then it will take approximately 8 semesters to complete degree requirements. This can be done in less than four years if a student registers for more than two semesters in some years, has sufficient proficiency in English and Mathematics, and plans the schedules well. Students are responsible for meeting degree requirements. Before selecting the courses in each semester students should consult their academic advisor. The University reserves the right to change programs and curricula without notice whenever circumstances warrant such changes. Meeting graduation requirements is each student's responsibility. They include the following:  1. A minimum of 124 credits (123 for B.A. in English) for a bachelor's degree of which at least 60 must have been earned at NSU as a student admitted into a degree program (residency requirement) .  2. Completion of all course requirements for the degree including major, minor, concentration, GEd etc.  3. At least a 2.00 (C) cumulative grade point average in all University courses attempted and a 2.5 in all degree core and concentration electives required for graduation. A student must earn a grade of D or better to pass a course.  4. Clearance from NSU Accounts and Library.  Fulfillment of the above conditions does not necessarily mean that a degree will be conferred on the student. The University reserves the right to refuse the awarding of a degree on disciplinary and other grounds. The courses comprising the 124-credit requirement can be categorized as follows.\n",
            "General Education (GEd) Courses\n",
            "These courses (27 credits) are required of all students regardless of degree, major or minor concentration. They should be completed early in a student's program (first two years) at NSU. A course which is a prerequisite for a GEd course does not satisfy the GEd requirement, but such a course may meet the minimum degree requirement of 124 credits. Courses taken to fulfill core or elective categories may also satisfy the general education requirement. GEd requirements for all department except English are:  3 credits of Mathematics (MAT125 or higher level)  6 credits of English composition (ENG1O3 and ENG1O5, or higher level)  3 credits of Computer Science / Information Systems  3 credits of Environmental Studies  3 credits of Basic Science from the disciplines of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Earth Sciences  9 credits of liberal arts, humanities, social sciences, and business, in disciplines other than the student's degree.\n",
            "Core Courses\n",
            "These are the courses specifically required for a degree (BBA, BA, and BS). The required credits vary for each degree, but comprise approximately 60% of the total degree requirement. Students must maintain at least a 2.5 grade point average in these courses in order to graduate.\n",
            "Major Concentration\n",
            "These are courses specifically required for major concentration within a degree. The credits required vary, but combined with other electives they comprise approximately 10% of the degree requirement. Students must maintain at least a 2.5 grade point average in these courses in order to graduate.\n",
            "Minor Concentration\n",
            "All Programs offer Minor in each of the concentration areas. Students may choose to do a Minor in addition to their major concentration by completing additional course requirements. The Minor concentration broadens students' specialization and increases their marketability. A student may complete the requirements for a Minor concentration without increasing the total credit-hour requirements for the BBA degree because, the same courses may fulfill the open elective requirement.\n",
            "Open Electives\n",
            "Any course selected by a student to fulfill the degree requirement of 124 credits after core, major, minor and GEd requirements are satisfied, is open electives course. These are selected according to availability and student's preference.\n",
            "Dual Major\n",
            "Departments and Programs, also offer Dual Major. A student has to fulfill the requirements for two major concentration areas to obtain a Dual Major\n",
            "Internship\n",
            "An internship is a program whereby a student, usually after completing all courses, undertakes an affiliation with an organization, under faculty supervision, for the purpose of applying knowledge gained from their NSU studies and to gain experience in the business world. The Department of Career Services provides assistance to students in arranging internships. Such experiences are approved in advance by the faculty advisor and can last from 8-10 weeks after which the student is assigned credits and grades based on an evaluation by the faculty supervisor, by a staff where the internship is performed, and a written report prepared by the intern. Credits assigned may vary for internships. Special projects or research work of high standard may be substituted for an internship when formally authorized in advance by the Academic Council. Internships can also be used as electives or to replace a required course if approved in advance by the Academic Council.\n",
            "Conditions of Internship\n",
            "Students must complete at least 100 credits to be eligible for internship. Students shall not be registered into any course during internship unless authorized by the Department Head and'the Dean,\n",
            "Duration of Internship\n",
            "For purpose of fulfilling degree requirement, students should be interned in organizations ideally for 8-10 weeks allowing two to three more weeks for preparing draft and final reports.\n",

            "Graduate education, comprised of Graduate Diploma, Master and PhD study programs, is an important investment in one’s career development. This is more so in an increasingly globalized job market. In appreciation of this reality, North South University already offers 15 graduate study programs at master’s level (see the list below). These programs, taught by faculty members with PhD degree from reputed universities, offer excellent opportunities for fresh undergraduates as well as those who are in jobs already to further develop their potential as intellectual leaders for a wide range of career paths in business, industry, government, research institutions, universities, NGOs and international agencies.   In January 2015, NSU took another pioneering step by establishing an Office of Graduate Studies and Research (GSR). It is entrusted with the overall responsibility of enhancing quality of graduate education by promoting coordination among NSU’s graduate education programs and facilitating learning from each other’s experiences as well as from national and international experiences. Schools and departments are responsible for the design and delivery of graduate research programs and for the welfare of graduate students. The overarching goal of the Office of the Graduate Studies and Research is to contribute to NSU acquiring increased national and international recognition as a quality graduate degree-conferring institution.\n",
            "For facilitating the work of the GSR Office, a Graduate Council, comprising of the Director of GSR (who is also the Chair of the Council), School Deans and Graduate Program Coordinators (GPCs), has been formed. The council serves as an advisory body of the GSR Office. NSU’s Treasurer and its Consultant for Educational Quality are also members of the council. The photograph shows the participants in the first ever meeting of the Graduate Council on 19 February 2015.\n",
            "The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Atique Islam, is with the Director of Graduate Studies and Research, Prof ATM Nurul Amin (centre) and the Graduate Program Coordinators (right to left) - Dr. AQMA Rahman Bhuiyan, Dr. Md Akhter Hossain, Dr. Hafiz Abdur Rahman, Dr. SK Tawfique M.

Graduate students have access to NSU’s financial support system as well as opportunity to work for faculty research projects. Currently NSU offers the following graduate degree programs:\n",
            "The credit requirement varies from 30 to 60, so does the research/thesis requirement depending on program’s professional or specialization requirement. The Office of GSR coordinates the graduate application and admission processes with the schools, departments, and graduate program coordinators (GPCs). The graduate application minimum requirements are:\n",
            "The screened applications are then called for an Admission Test. The final assessment is based on:\n",
            "Graduates with bachelor degree from universities in the country including those of NSU’s own and those from other countries enroll in these graduate study programs. NSU master degree serves the graduates well for professional jobs at home and abroad and for doing PhD in good universities in developed counties.The intake time is January, May and September. Applications are received throughout the year. Respective academic unit’s Graduate Program Coordinators or the GSR Office may be contacted for further information. (See below).\n",
            "The Office Graduate Study and Research also promotes graduate student research to foster and sustain an environment of academic excellence at NSU. The graduate student research is guided by a committee of three faculty members, of whom one serves as the research supervisor and Chair of the committee. The student chooses the supervisor according to required expertise to guide the research. The student then, in consultation with the supervisor, chooses two other faculty members for completing the committee. One of the three-member committee comes from a sister department or discipline.\n",
            "By following the tradition and practice of global university system, NSU funds faculty participation and presentation of papers in international seminars and conferences and their publication in conference proceedings or submission to peer reviewed international journals. In recent years a big boost to funding of graduate education and research at NSU has occurred from initiatives of individual faculty members and departments that have led to research collaborations with national and internal organizations at home and abroad. Meanwhile, NSU has also launched its support for faculty research. The Office Graduate Study and Research supports faculty research to foster and sustain an environment of academic excellence at NSU. It promotes faculty initiatives of joint and collaborative research activities between the national and international organizations. The GSR Office is committed to accord recognition to faculty research efforts and outputs.\n",
            "Graduate seminar is a key building block for success in graduate education and research and the career thereafter.  Thus, GSR Office, in cooperation with the academic units, seeks to promote graduate seminars on a regular basis. The purpose of graduate seminars is to provide graduate students with exposure to the style of presentation and scholarly discussions centering different research issues including policy implications of research findings.\n",
            "The GSR work would also involve conducting Tracer Study of NSU graduates with master degree to know about their academic and professional advancement since their graduation from NSU and to receive feedback as to how their respective curriculum has served them to pursue their career. The tracer study findings are important inputs for curriculum revision that are processed through NSU’s Academic Council.\n",
